# Trellal

The idea is to make a "Trello All", see all boards from an organization in a single screen. That allows for a unique workflow, single kanban.

## Development

To submit Feature Requests or Report Bugs just [create an issue](https://github.com/brunolm/trellal/issues/new) and it will be synced to Trello's backlog.
